# Analysis-of-Fitness-Data-Project

With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data withgadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated. I have analysed answers to questions like:

• How fast, long, and intense was the run today?

• Have the user succeeded with their training goals?

• What's the progress?

• What were the best achievements?•How do the user performed compared to others?

This data was exported from Runkeeper.
Dataset is a csv file.
